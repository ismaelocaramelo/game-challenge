# Game-challenge

##Purpose
Improve existing game of Command Line Games, Inc. 

##Initial issues:

- The game does not gracefully handle bad user input.

- In its current form, it’s supposed to be played at a difficulty level of “hard”, meaning the computerplayer cannot be beaten. In reality, however, the computer player can be beaten in certainsituations. This is more like a “medium” difficulty level.

- The game play left a lot to be desired. The user messages are lacking. They’re unclear. It’sconfusing to see the spot that’s selected and the board all on the screen. It’s easy to get lost in what’s happening. It’s weird the way the computer picks its spot without notifying the user.##Features to implement

- Allow the user to choose the game type (human v. human, computer v. computer, human v. computer).

- Allow the user to choose which player goes first.

- Allow the user to choose with what “symbol” the players will mark their selections on the board(traditionally it’s “X” and “O”).
